                        Rabbits (Leporidae Lagomorpha) are small mammals. There are an abundant breed of rabbits and they are found both in the wild or in domestic homes as pets.
                        <br>
                        Rabbits are not to be confused with hares. While hares live in a simple nest above the ground and enjoy their solitude, rabbits live in burrows or warrens and enjoy being in a social group.
                        <br>
                        Rabbits are prey animals and must be aware of their surroundings at all times. <br>
                        When confronted by an potiential threat, they may freeze up and and observe their surroundings. They will also thump the ground with their paws to warn others in the warren. Mother rabbits have a scent that attract predators and will stay away from the nest in order to protect their young from being found. She'll occassionaly go back just to fed her young. 
                        <br>
                        Habitats for rabbits include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands. However, they have been a source of enviornmental problems specifically due to the rate of which they breed and their appetite.
