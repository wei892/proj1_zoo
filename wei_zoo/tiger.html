                    <p > 
                        Tigers (Panthera tigris) is one of the largest member of the cat family. They are recognized by their orange fur and dark verticle stripes. They are very territorial and require large areas of habitat. Territories are maintained through claw marking of trees, fecal deposits, depositing scents by rubbing their facial glanfd, and scrapings on the ground.

                        Considered as an apex predator, they reside at the top of the food chain. A tiger's main diet consists of deers and wild boars.
