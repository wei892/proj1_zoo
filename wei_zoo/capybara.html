                        Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent native to South Americas.  
                        Capybaras inhabit savannas and dense forests, typically living in large bodies of water. They are semi-aquatic animals and are excellent swimmer. Capybaras can hold their breath underwater for up to 5 minutes. They are a very social species and are often found in large groups.

                        Capybara are herbivores: they mainly feed on grasses and aquatic plants. They are picky and feel on leaves of only one species while leaving the other plant species around it. However, they will eat a more varied diet during the dry season when fewer plants are available.
                        <br> 
                        Capybaras are unable to synthesize vitamin C on their own. In capitivy, capybaras are reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy is not supplemented with vitamin C.
