        Lions, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," are powerful and majestic big cats native to Africa
         and a small population in the Gir Forest of India. They are known for their striking appearance, with a 
         tawny coat, a distinctive mane (in males), and a muscular build. Lions are social animals, living in prides 
         typically consisting of related females and their offspring, along with a few dominant males. These prides 
         work together to hunt and protect their territory, showcasing remarkable teamwork and communication skills. 
         Lions are apex predators, preying primarily on herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are 
         capable of impressive bursts of speed and strength when hunting. Despite their status as apex predators, lions 
         face various threats, including habitat loss and conflict with humans. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring 
         the continued survival of these iconic big cats.
