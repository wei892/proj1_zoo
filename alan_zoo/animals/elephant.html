        Elephants are among the most majestic and iconic creatures on Earth. 
        These large, herbivorous mammals are known for their incredible size, 
        with the African elephant being the largest land animal, reaching heights 
        of up to 13 feet (4 meters) at the shoulder and weighing as much as 14,000 
        pounds (6,350 kilograms). They are characterized by their long, prehensile 
        trunks, which are versatile tools used for various tasks such as feeding, 
        drinking, and communication. Elephants are highly social animals, forming 
        close-knit family groups led by a matriarch. Their intelligence is remarkable, 
        and they exhibit complex behaviors, including problem-solving and a strong sense 
        of empathy. Unfortunately, elephants face numerous threats, including habitat loss, 
        poaching for their ivory tusks, and conflicts with humans, making conservation efforts 
        critical to their survival.
