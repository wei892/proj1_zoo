    <p>Penguins are a group of flightless aquatic birds primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere. However only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, can be found north of the Equator. Penguins have dark and white colors on their bodies for camouflage and flippers for swimming.They mainly feed on krill, fish, squid, and other marine creatures, capturing their prey with their bills and swallowing it whole while swimming. Penguins have spiny tongues and powerful jaws for gripping slippery prey. They also divide their time almost evenly between land and sea.</p>
