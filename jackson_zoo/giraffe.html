    <p>The giraffe is a large hoofed mammal native to Africa and are distinct from other animals since they are the tallest animals on earth. They have exceptionally long neck and legs, and have a distinct color pattern around their body. Giraffes are found in many different areas across Africa and can be found in savannahs and woodlands. Their diets consists of leaves, fruits, and flowers and can access them from heights that are unreachable by most other herbivores. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable from extinction, but conservation efforts have been to protect this species.</p>
