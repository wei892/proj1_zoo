    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia and mostly resides in trees. They are primarily located in the coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia. Koalas primarily inhabit open Eucalyptus woodlands, and Eucalyptus leaves are a majority of their diet. Eucalyptus leaves are vital for Koalas, but other mammals are discouraged from eating them due to their limited nutritional value and toxic compounds. Koalas are notably sendentary, and can sleep up to 20 hours per day. Their body length typically ranges from 60 to 85 centimeters with a weight spanning between 4 to 15 kilograms. </p>
