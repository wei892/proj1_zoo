    <p>Gorillas are a species of primates that live in the forests of Africa. They are known for their remarkable size, second only to humans among primates. They can reach heights between 120 and 180 centimeters, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 260 metres. These herbivorous animals primarily consume leaves, stems, and fruits. They live in families led by a big, older gorilla called a "silverback" because of its silvery fur on its back. Unfortnately, Gorillas are critically endangered due to diseases, poaching, and habitual destruction.</p>
